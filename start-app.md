Above hash's password is = primeroot123!

After trying to login `auth/login` from swagger first time, you can use this input:

```json{
  "username": "idanishraza@gmail.com OR YOUR EMAIL HERE",
  "password": "primeroot123!"
}
```

system will force you to change password anyway bt responding:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "FirstTimerChangePassword",
  "message": "change password"
}
```

so you will have to create your own password from `auth/changepass`

Thats it, Thank you üôè!
